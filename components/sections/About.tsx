        I am an MCA final-year student with hands-on experience in
        building and deploying full-stack applications using modern
        web technologies.
        <br /><br />
        My work spans from developing secure backend APIs and
        responsive frontends to designing CI/CD pipelines, Dockerized
        services, and Kubernetes deployments on cloud and on-prem
        infrastructure.
