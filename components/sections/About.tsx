      <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        I am an MCA final-year student with practical experience in both
        full-stack development and DevOps engineering.
        <br /><br />
        I have worked on real-world projects involving MERN stack
        applications, RESTful APIs, authentication systems, database
        design, and payment gateway integration. Alongside development,
        I have designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines and deployed
        applications using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Nginx on
        cloud and on-prem infrastructure.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy working close to production systems — understanding
        applications end-to-end, debugging deployment issues, and
        building reliable, scalable solutions.
